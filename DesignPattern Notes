Factory Class :
1. it does not expose the creational logic to the client and refer the created object using a standard interface.
whether object is created using new keyword, or autowiring 
2. Also known as virtual constructor

Steps:

2. factory class returns the required class instance

Abstract Factory Class:
Engineer, Teacher and Engineer Trainee, Teacher Trainee
Profession Abstract Factory and Trainee Profession Abstract Factory
Main Class -> Abstract Factory Producer(getProfession() method)  -> Abstract factory(abstrct class)

1. This factory is also called as factory of factories
2. Abstract factory lets a class returns a factory of classes
3. So, this is the reason that abstract factory pattern is one level higher than factory pattern.

Steps:
1. create main class which call factory of factory class
2. factory of factory/ factory producer creates instance of factory class.
3. factory class return the required instance.
